_HELLO!_
the program turns any text to it's brainfuck equivalent.

you can run this program just by typing make in the terminal.
(you need to install make from gnu if you haven't got it already (to the window users lol)).

you need to input the text in the input.txt file
then run the make command
and you'll get the brainfuck output in the output.txt file.
